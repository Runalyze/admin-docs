RUNALYZE docs for admins
========================

These docs are for admins hosting an installation of `RUNALYZE <https://runalyze.com>`_.
If you're looking for the user docs visit our `Help <https://help.runalyze.com/>`_.

.. note::
   RUNALYZE started as one-man-project with only one user and has grown to an
   app with around 17.000 users of our `official online version <https://runalyze.com/>`_.
   Server requirements and complexity of the app and its configuration grow with
   the feature list. Please understand that our main focus is on implementing
   new features and serving a performant online version. Therefore, support for
   local installations is limited.
