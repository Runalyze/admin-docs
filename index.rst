   `Changes concerning the OpenSource alignment of RUNALYZE <https://blog.runalyze.com/allgemein-en/changes-opensource-alignment/>`_

.. note::
   RUNALYZE started as one-man-project with only one user and has grown to an
   app with around 18.000 users of our `official online version <https://runalyze.com/>`_.
   Server requirements and complexity of the app and its configuration grow with
   the feature list. Version 4.3 is the latest version for self hosted versions.
