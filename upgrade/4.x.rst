Update instructions for v4.x
============================

.. note::
   RUNALYZE started as one-man-project with only one user and has grown to an
   app with around 13.000 users of our `official online version <https://runalyze.com/>`_.
   Server requirements and complexity of the app and its configuration grow with
   the feature list. Please understand that our main focus is on implementing
   new features and serving a performant online version. Therefore, support for
   local installations is limited.

General instructions
********************

* RUNALYZE follows `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.
* If not stated otherwise, patch updates do not require any further adjustments.
  Just copy the files into your working directory.
* You should be able to update from version 4.0 to the latest 4.x version.
  Nevertheless, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that skipping a minor version
  will always work. Therefore you should follow the update process for each
  minor version.
* Execute the update via cli if you have big installations or a slow server!
* Clear the cache by deleting the content of the directories ``var/cache/prod``
  and ``var/cache/doctrine`` or by executing the command ``cache:clean`` and
  ``doctrine:cache:clear-metadata``.

.. warning:: Never forget to make a backup before updating or changing your
    RUNALYZE installation. (You break it - you fix it)
