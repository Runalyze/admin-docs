Installation instructions for v3.x
==================================

The following instructions are valid only for official `RUNALYZE releases starting from version 3.0 <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/releases>`_.
If you want to use our current development version, have a look at our :doc:`checkout instructions </checkout>`.

In general, RUNALYZE requires at least PHP 5.6.0+ (maximum PHP 7.0.*) and MySQL 5.0.0+. We encourage you to use the latest MySQL versions for future releases (5.7), but note that RUNALYZE is incompatible with sql mode ``ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`` (see :ref:`faq <sql_mode_only_full_group_by>`).

General
-------
Since version 3.0 the ``web`` directory is the public web directory. We strongly
recommend you to use a specific (sub)domain for your RUNALYZE installation.
Otherwise, it's your responsibility to secure your configuration files and we
cannot guarantee that all parts of RUNALYZE will work as expected.

To install an official release, download the respective \*.zip or \*.tar.gz file and unpack the archive. Check that the files are owned by the webserver user.


Copy ``app/config/default_config.yml`` to ``data/config.yml`` and adjust at least the following settings::

    database_host: 127.0.0.1     # database hostname or ip  (e.g. localhost, 127.0.0.1 ...)
    database_prefix: runalyze_   # table prefix of the new RUNALYZE installation
    database_port: 3306          # port of the database server (normally 3306)
    database_name: runalyze      # database name
    database_user: root          # database username
    database_password: "xxx"     # database password
    
.. note::
    You need to clear your cache (``var/cache/prod/`` in general) for the changes to take effect.


Adjust your webserver configuration (see example configuration further down on this page).

Afterwards open ``/install`` in your browser and follow the instructions. This will work only if the database settings are correct.

Installation on a webspace
---------------------------
If you are using a webhosting space (like e.g. `Netcup* <https://www.netcup.eu/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1213>`_) it should be really easy to install RUNALYZE.

.. note:: We recommend a webspace with ssh access (for longer lasting tasks), perl (for fit file import) and cronjobs (needed for later versions). Do not forget that you need at least PHP 5.5.9+

1. Download the latest version from `Github <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/releases>`_ and extract it to a folder of your choice.
2. Pay attention to the directories. the ``web`` directory is the public web directory. Everything above should be better not visible to the public. Best practice is to setup a subdomain and point it to the ``web`` directory
3. Copy and adjust the configuration (have a look at the `General` section on this page)


Ubuntu/Debian distributions
---------------------------

Packages:

``php-gettext php-zip php-curl php-xml php-mbstring libxml2 gettext php-intl perl``

(Use the corresponding version php packages names)

Optional:

 * :ref:`Install and configure <time-zone-detection>` the timezone recognization database
 * :ref:`Download the elevation correction srtm data <elevation-srtm-files>`


You may need to install the corresponding locales to get the translations running:
Have a look in ``less /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED`` whether the locale is already installed.
If not you have to install the locales on the system(the following example is for the german language)::

    sudo locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8

And now just follow the `General installation` guide at the top of the page.


Windows
-------

.. warning:: We encourage you to use a unix system. We cannot guarantee that RUNALYZE will always be compatible with a Windows system. You will get the best experience with a unix system.

.. warning:: The `ttbin`-Importer will only work with a unix system.

In order to use the `fit`-Importer you need to install perl and have to set the corresponding path in the configuration.

The installation of a webserver (apache) and database server (MariaDB) is really easy. Just use the `XAMPP package <https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html>`_. There are enough tutorials on the web, which direct you through the installation of XAMPP.

Running RUNALYZE on Apache
--------------------------

.. warning:: Required Apache modules - You need to enable ``mod_rewrite`` for Apache. On Debian-based systems you can do this by ``a2enmod rewrite``

Please take a look at the `symfony documentation <http://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html>`_ for alternatives of the apache configuration if you having problems with this one.

Create a new virtual host:
Version: Apache >= 2.4::

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName domain.tld
        ServerAlias www.domain.tld

        DocumentRoot /var/www/project/web
        <Directory /var/www/project/web>
            AllowOverride None
            Require all granted

            <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
                Options -MultiViews
                RewriteEngine On
                RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
                RewriteRule ^(.*)$ app.php [QSA,L]
            </IfModule>
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/project_error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/project_access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>


Running RUNALYZE on NGINX
-------------------------

Adjust the PHP-FPM config to your needs::

    server {
        server_name domain.tld www.domain.tld;
        root /var/www/project/web;
        
        client_max_body_size       30m;

        location / {
            # try to serve file directly, fallback to app.php
            try_files $uri /app.php$is_args$args;
        }

        location ~ ^/app\.php(/|$) {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock; #adjust the socket path to your needs
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.*)$;
            include fastcgi_params;

            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT $realpath_root;

            internal;
        }

        error_log /var/log/nginx/project_error.log;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/project_access.log;
    }
